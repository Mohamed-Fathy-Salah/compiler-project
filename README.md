## idea
in our project (this repo), we build code analyzer that helps in detect code blocks in the input java program file then statically test if this blocks will work or not then produce html file as output that highlighted this blocks by green if this blocks will works or red if not. 
there is a third case in branches (if/else/for/while) which has more than one condition in OR (||) expression, and their some condition will be false and some be true then highlight the boolean expression by yellow but the block will be  highlighted by green as it will excuted.
